# RockyProject

Rocky is a self-balancing robot using a modified Balboa 32U4 Balancing Robot Kit sourced from Polulu Robotics and Electronics. The goal of this project is taken from a classic control theory problem - to balance an inverted pendulum on a horizontally-translating cart. In order to do so, we designed a control system that would maintain the robot's upright position, even when experiencing an impact disturbance. 

See the Rocky Project report for more details on our design process.
